# Dotfiles

From Base Install
-------
 * After initial install (and having installed git packages) proceed to the void installer folder and run install.sh (as sudo) and github_rsa
 * If required to have multiple drives, assign them using the fstab template in (desktopfiles/files/fstab)
 * Use CopyDotFiles.sh (might require to run once with sudo to copy and one without sudo)
